<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate person in tech with a diverse background, blending education in Iraq and
Cardiff, UK. A dedicated wife and mother of two, balances technical expertise with strong
multitasking and problem-solving skills. I am passionate about designing digital experiences
that are both visually stunning and intuitive.</p>
<p>I found myself in software development because it flexes my creativity and problem-solving
skills and constantly evolves to incorporate new technology. I have developed a keen interest
in web development through self-directed learning and online courses on Coursera. I have
honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have gained a solid foundation in JavaScript
and acquired fundamental knowledge of Git, GitHub, and React. My current focus is on
further refining my skills to transition into a career as a software developer.</p>
<p>I am a highly motivated person to return to my career and am very keen to learn and
develop skills. "No giving up" is my motto, even when struggling. My enthusiasm for
continuous learning is evident in my accomplishments, such as quickly advancing through
two levels of the English GCSE course at Cardiff and Vale College in a single academic year. I
scored B in English and Math GCSE, which gives me communication skills in both Arabic and
English.</p>
